                                        different views on the derivation of the name "KASARAGOD ". One view is that it is the combination of two Sanskrit words Kaasaara (which means lake or pond) and Kroda (which means a place where treasure is kept).
                                        Another view is that it is the place where Kaasaraka trees (Strychnos nux vomica or Kaanjiram or Kaaraskara) are in abundance. Both views are relevant as there are large number of rivers, lakes and ponds in the
                                        coastal belt of the district besides thick flora consisting of innumerable varieties of trees, shrubs etc. particularly plenty of Kaasaraka trees. Many Arab travellers, who came to Kerala between 9th and 14th centuries
                                        A.D., visited Kasaragod as it was then an important trade centre. They called this area Harkwillia. </p>

                                    <p class="card-text text-justify ">Kannur district derived its name from the location of its headquarters at Kannur town. The old name 'Cannanore' is the anglicised form of the Malayalam word Kannur. According to one opinion, 'Kannur' is a derivation
                                        from Kanathur, an ancient village, the name of which survives even today in one of the wards of Kannur Municipality. Another version is that Kannur might have assumed its name from one of the , deities of the Hindu
                                        pantheon, a compound of two words, Kannan (Lord Krishna) and Ur (place) making it the place of Lord Krishna. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the deity of the Katalayi Sreekrishna temple was originally
                                        installed in a shrine at Katalayi Kotta in the south eastern part of the present Kannur town.</p>

                                        of paddy fields. It is a picturesque plateau situated at a height between 700 m and 2100 m above the mean sea level nested among the mountains of the Western Ghats on the eastern portion of north Kerala, bordering
                                        the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The district was carved out from the then Kozhikode and Kannur districts. About 885.92 sq. km of area is under forest. The culture of Wayanad is mainly tribal oriented. Though
                                        considered as backward, this district is perhaps one of the biggest foreign exchange earners of the State, with its production of cash crops like pepper, cardamom, coffee, tea, spices and other condiments.</p>

                                        Kozhikode paved the way for trade tourism in India. This trade centre is regaining much of its ancient glory by opening up air routes to Persian Gulf and other regions.</p>

                                        since ancient times. This district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts (uprisings against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. It was a famous centre for Hindu - Vedic learning
                                        and Islamic philosophy and a place of cultural heritage.</p>
